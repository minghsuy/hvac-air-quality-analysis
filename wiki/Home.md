- [Start Collecting Data](Data-Collection)
- [Understanding Your Results](Analysis-Techniques)

## 📊 Key Findings
After 6 months of monitoring:
- MERV 13 upgrade reduced PM2.5 by **71%**
- Indoor air quality is **52x better** than WHO guidelines
- Data-driven replacement can save **$130-910/year**
- Outdoor monitoring is **essential** for accurate efficiency calculations

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving
Manufacturers say "replace every 3-12 months" - that's a **$780/year** uncertainty! With real data, you can:
- Replace filters based on actual performance
- Detect problems before health impacts
- Save money on unnecessary replacements
- Protect your family during pollution events
